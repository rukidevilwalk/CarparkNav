<b>CarparkNav</b>

A web application used to search for the carparks and their availability within a distance from the destination. Multiple routes towards the destination carpark will be shown. The user can select a route to start his journey and the GPS navigation app will be launched.

The web application will continue running in the background and notify the user if the selected carpark's avaiablility drops below a certain threshold during the journey. This is achieved through service workers and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
